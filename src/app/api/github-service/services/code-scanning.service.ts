   * you'll get a 400 response with the message:
   *
   * ```
   * Analysis specified is not deletable.
   * ```
   *
   * The response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with
   * two alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:
   * `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.
   * Use the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis
   * in a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis
   * for the specified tool in your repository.
   * Use the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.
   * When you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`
   * in the 200 response is `null`.
   *
   * As an example of the deletion process,
   * let's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool
   * to analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:
   * 10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.
   * You therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.
   * You've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.
   * To do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.
   * To start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.
   * Each set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.
   * Having found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,
   * delete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.
   * Then repeat the process for the second set.
   * The procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:
   *
   * **Outer loop**:
   * * List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.
   * * Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:
   *
   *   **Inner loop**:
   *   * Delete the identified analysis.
   *   * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.
   *
   * The above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.

   * Delete a code scanning analysis from a repository.
   *
   * Deletes a specified code scanning analysis from a repository.

   * There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.
   *  - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)."
   *  - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see "[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."

   *
   * SARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.
   * To get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries.

  /**
   * Upload an analysis as SARIF data.
   *
   * Uploads SARIF data containing the results of a code scanning analysis to make the results available in a repository. For troubleshooting information, see "[Troubleshooting SARIF uploads](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif)."
   *
   * There are two places where you can upload code scanning results.
   *  - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see "[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests)."
   *  - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see "[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository)."
   *
   * You must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:
   *
   * ```
   * gzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0
   * ```
   *
   * SARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.
   * To get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries. For more information, see "[SARIF results exceed one or more limits](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif/results-exceed-limit)."
