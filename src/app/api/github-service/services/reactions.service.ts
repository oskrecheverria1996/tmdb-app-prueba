   * OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `write:discussion` scope to use this endpoint.

   * This method provides access only to the response body.
   * To access the full response (for headers, for example), `reactionsCreateForTeamDiscussionLegacy$Response()` instead.
   *
   * This method sends `application/json` and handles request body of type `application/json`.
