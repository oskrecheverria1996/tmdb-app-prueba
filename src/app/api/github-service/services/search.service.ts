   * This endpoint does not accept authentication and will only include publicly visible users. As an alternative, you can use the GraphQL API. The GraphQL API requires authentication and will return private users, including Enterprise Managed Users (EMUs), that you are authorized to view. For more information, see "[GraphQL Queries](https://docs.github.com/graphql/reference/queries#search)."
   *
   * This method provides access only to the response body.
   * To access the full response (for headers, for example), `searchUsers$Response()` instead.
   *
   * This method doesn't expect any request body.
