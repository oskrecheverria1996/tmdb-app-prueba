   * Gets the total GitHub Actions cache usage for an organization.
   * The data fetched using this API is refreshed approximately every 5 minutes, so values returned from this endpoint may take at least 5 minutes to get updated.
   *
   * OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `read:org` scope to use this endpoint.
